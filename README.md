## Architecture Overview

### Diagram
![Architecture Diagram](#) **<img width="1199" alt="Architecture Nadeem" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c95046a-b34a-47dc-89a7-34cf00021f88" />


### Explanation
1. **Front-End**:
   - Built using **ReactJS** for a component-based architecture.
   - Uses **React Router** for navigation (if applicable).
   - Styled with **CSS** and **Material-UI** for a modern and responsive design.

2. **Back-End (Hypothetical)**:
   - If implemented, the back-end would use **Node.js** with **Express** to handle API requests.
   - Data would be stored in **MongoDB** for scalability.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Front-end deployed on **Vercel** for fast and scalable hosting.
   - Back-end deployed on **Heroku** with a **MongoDB Atlas** database.

4. **Scalability Plan**:
   - Use **caching** (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
   - Implement **load balancing** to handle high traffic.
   - Use **Docker** for containerization to ensure consistency across environments.
